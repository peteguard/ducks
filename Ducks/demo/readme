Simple Demo

Run the servers, starting each in order.
You will need to run each in its own terminal window.

java -jar Jars/Ducks.jar Config/super.txt

java -jar Jars/Ducks.jar Config/regional.txt

java -jar Jars/Ducks.jar Config/local.txt


Then run:


java -jar Jars/Ducktester.jar Config/tester.txt



This simulates a global network.  Super being the key source,
regional being a server for a country, local being the server
in the data center, and the tester representing a container.


The Logs folder will hold logs for each of the servers and the tester
Tail the logs and follow along

tail -f Logs/


The Data file contains the persisted copy of each servers keys.
Look but don't edit.  


At the prompt in the tester enter a key name and hit return
You should see something like this

> Foo
Key=1

Ducks has just given you a unique key of 1 for whatever Foo is.
Nobody else will get that number.


Try another, but ask for a range of keys

> Goo 5
Start=1 Last=5

You have been given keys 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
